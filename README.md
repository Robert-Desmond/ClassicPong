# ClassicPong
Simple Pong game.

Two players are required. I had it to where the right paddle would just follow the balls Y movement but it wasn't very fun to play against. 
I will most likely come back to this project in the future to add some basic form of Ai.
Also, I was going to customize it more but it didn't really look that good so I left the classic style.
